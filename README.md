# Simple Desktop App (No Logic Implemented)

This is a simple desktop app using Electron js.

This simple app is just for testing how Electron works.

## Credit
The design of the Login Form is made by **`Mohan Khadka`**, you can find his code out here: [Day 001 Login Form](https://codepen.io/khadkamhn/pen/ZGvPLo)

## Libraries I used
If you are curiuos about the chart when you click on Sign In, it's made by `Chart.js`, you can know more about it from here: [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## How to use
As the name of the repo mentioned this electron app is made for a friend, you can consider it as a prototype, so it has no logic, just click on Sign In, and you be redirected to the graph page.
